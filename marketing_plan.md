# Blueprint Legends Marketing Plan (Month 1)

## Objectives
1. Generate brand awareness among hobbyists, collectors, and design enthusiasts.
2. Achieve 25 poster sales in the first month.
3. Build a subscriber list of at least 100 email addresses.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Men aged 25–55 interested in vintage machinery, sci‑fi, steampunk, and engineering aesthetics.
- **Secondary:** Home decor enthusiasts seeking unique wall art for offices, man caves, or living spaces.

## Channels & Strategies

### Social Media
- **Instagram & Pinterest:** Post daily lifestyle shots of posters, behind‑the‑scenes printing videos, and close‑up detail shots. Use hashtags such as `#blueprintart`, `#steampunkdecor`, `#retroposters`, `#engineerart`.
- **Facebook:** Share long‑form posts about the design process, including design sketches and the history of blueprint art. Join and contribute to niche groups (e.g., vintage tractor enthusiasts, retro sci‑fi collectors) and provide value before promoting products.
- **TikTok/Reels:** Create short 15‑30 second videos showing the transformation from AI prompt to printed poster; use trending sounds within decor and art communities.

### Paid Advertising
- Allocate an initial budget of **$150** distributed over four campaigns:
  1. **Facebook/Instagram Advantage+** – Target interests like “mechanical engineering,” “retro science fiction,” and “DIY decor” within the US and Canada. Run A/B tests on two creatives (short video vs. static image).  
  2. **Pinterest Promoted Pins** – Promote pins of your best-selling posters; target users searching for “man cave ideas” and “blueprint decor.”  
  3. **Google Shopping Ads** – Integrate via Shopify; set a low daily budget to collect search intent for “blueprint posters” and measure conversions.  
  4. **Etsy Ads** – Promote top 3 listings for targeted keywords (e.g., “blueprint art poster,” “fantasy blueprint”). Keep bids moderate ($1/day per listing).

### Content Marketing
- Launch a blog on your Shopify site. Write one article per week with topics such as:
  - "The History of Blueprint Art and Why It’s Back in Style"
  - "How We Create Our Futuristic Blueprint Designs Using AI"
  - "Decorating Your Home Office with Technical Art"
- Use ChatGPT and SurferSEO for keyword research and optimize content for search engines.

### Email Marketing
- Set up Mailchimp welcome automation: offer new subscribers a **10% discount** in exchange for email signup.
- Send weekly newsletters highlighting new posters, blog posts, and subscriber-only discounts.

### Influencer & Community Outreach
- Identify micro‑influencers (1k–20k followers) in retro art, sci‑fi, and engineering niches. Offer them free posters in exchange for a review or feature.
- Reach out to local makerspaces and engineering clubs; provide a discount code for members.

## Metrics & KPIs
- **Traffic:** 1,000 unique visitors to Shopify site.
- **Conversion Rate:** 2% of website visitors making a purchase.
- **Email Signups:** 100 new subscribers.
- **Ad ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** At least 2.5x.
- **Social Growth:** 500 followers combined across platforms.

## Month‑End Evaluation
At the end of 30 days:
- Review sales per design and adjust product lineup (retire underperforming designs and expand on best sellers).
- Analyze ad results; scale campaigns with the highest ROAS and pause ineffective ones.
- Plan content themes for next month (e.g., holiday‑themed blueprints) based on emerging trends.
