# Blueprint Legends Brand Kit

## Logo Concept
Use a blueprint pattern background combined with an abstract monogram or wordmark. The design should suggest drafting paper and engineering creativity without depicting real machines or any specific brands. A simple "BL" monogram or the full name "Blueprint Legends" in a technical, sans‑serif font can overlay the pattern. Avoid using real trademarked logos or patented designs.

## Color Palette

| Purpose | Color | Hex | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary | **Blueprint Blue** | `#0A3D62` | Deep, saturated blue reminiscent of traditional drafting paper. |
| Secondary | **Steel Grey** | `#7B8FA1` | Neutral steel tone to complement the primary blue. |
| Accent | **Pastel Orange** | `#F2A365` | Warm accent to draw attention to calls‑to‑action, highlights or packaging inserts. |
| Neutral | **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Clean contrast for text and backgrounds. |

## Typography

- **Headings**: *Montserrat Bold* – Modern, geometric sans‑serif with a technical feel.  
- **Body Text**: *Source Sans Pro* – Readable sans‑serif for long descriptions and blog posts.  
- **Optional Accent Font**: *Fira Code* or similar monospaced typeface for technical annotations in graphics.

## Tagline

> **"Blueprint Your Imagination"**

This tagline emphasizes creativity and the transformative power of turning ideas into tangible art.

## Visual Style Guidelines

- Embrace blueprint aesthetics: thin white lines on dark blue backgrounds, grid patterns, and technical labels.  
- Use minimalist, clean compositions. Avoid clutter or unnecessary textures.  
- Incorporate abstract geometric shapes (gears, pipes, circuits) rather than depicting specific real-world devices.  
- When designing packaging, consider using matte blue tubes with white typography and subtle line patterns.

## Branding Use Cases

- **Logo:** Place the monogram or wordmark on a blueprint pattern background. Use white or pastel orange for the lettering.  
- **Product Headers:** Apply the primary blue as a background with pastel orange highlights on headings.  
- **Website:** Use steel grey and white for body sections with blue accents for buttons and links.  
- **Social Media:** Maintain consistent use of colors and fonts across posts. Display the tagline periodically.  

This brand kit provides a cohesive framework for all visual materials, ensuring Blueprint Legends conveys professionalism, creativity and technical craftsmanship.
